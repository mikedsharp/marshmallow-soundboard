# Soundboard
An all-purpose cross-platform customizable soundboard, written in Node.js.

## For people who just want to run the soundboard

Please check out the [Releases](https://github.com/mikedsharp/soundboard/releases) page. You can download the executable for your platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS are all supported!)

Once you've unzipped the release, here's how to get started:

### running the soundboard
1. On the computer you want the sounds to play from, run the `soundboard-listener` executable (either by double-clicking it from Explorer/Finder etc or by running from the command line in your OS terminal app). This will start a server that will provide the soundboard web app to whatever handheld device you want to use the soundboard
3. The very first time you run the soundboard, you may get a message box from your OS asking if you'd like to allow the app to run on your local network, you need to allow this so that the soundboard is available on your local network
4. Follow the on-screen instructions that show up in the command prompt/terminal window that appeared when you ran the app. The instructions should give you what you need to connect the touch device you want to use to control the soundboard with to the soundboard listener app
6. On the computer running the `soundboard-listener` app, grab some MP3 files and drop them into the `media` folder that came as part of the unzipped folder, you can drag sounds in and out of the `media` folder and the soundboard will automatically update.
7. You're all set up to use the soundboard, there are more customisation options, but this should get you started. Have fun!

## for people who want to modify the soundboard or run from source
I'll write this up soon...
